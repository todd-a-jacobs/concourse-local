## Purpose

The installer simplifies installation of
[Concourse-CI](https://concourse-ci.org/) and its *fly* CLI under macOS,
with support for the CLI's unsigned app, which (IIRC) the Pivotal
maintainers say they have no intention of addressing. ðŸ˜¢

## Prerequisites
These are required before running the installation script.

1. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
1. [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

## Dependencies
These dependencies are installed via the installation script, provided
the prerequisites have been met.

1. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
1. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (NB: This may be optional,
   but Docker Desktop seems happier when it's installed.)
1. [GNU Wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/)
